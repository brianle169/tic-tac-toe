# tic-tac-toe

A web-based, two-player Tic-tac-toe game. With an option for one-player mode.

Instead of the traditional 'X' and 'O' in most tic-tac-toe game. This version took on another style called "Life vs Death". Only the theme is changed, the concept and logic of tic-tac-toe remains the same.

Here are some images of this project.

Start Menu: In this menu, players will input their desired names. If the input fields are left blank, the default names are used as shown in the placeholder.
